## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Report privately through GitHub's
[**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/Jott2121/rag-guard/security/advisories/new)
flow (the repository's **Security → Advisories** tab). I aim to acknowledge
reports within 72 hours and to ship a fix or mitigation for confirmed issues as
quickly as is practical.

When reporting, please include:

- a description of the issue and its impact,
- steps to reproduce (a minimal proof-of-concept if possible), and
- any suggested remediation.

## Scope

`rag-guard` is a dependency-light retrieval guardrail library. Findings of
particular interest: prompt-injection or grounding bypass that defeats the
refusal logic, PII leakage past the redaction layer, unsafe deserialization,
and supply-chain risks in CI (this repository pins its GitHub Actions to commit
SHAs and runs CodeQL + Dependabot to reduce that surface).

Thanks for helping keep it solid.
